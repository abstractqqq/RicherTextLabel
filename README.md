# More colorful rich text label

This is a simple example on how to make specific words in rich text label hoverable with specific color change for each word upon hover. This is done by the use of the url tag and some specific syntax for url meta input. This same idea can then be applied to more advanced bbcode parsing for text-based games, for instance in-line choices for Visual Novels, or swapping out words when player hovers over the word, or other tricks like that. I looked up things online and couldn't find many resources on "interactive text maniplulation" and figured I should try changing text color as a first step. This example project is the result.
